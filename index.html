            <h3>I love animals, especially dogs.</h3>
        </header>
        <p>I have always been an animal lover. However, it was not until late last year that I was able to get a puppy of my own, a Japanese Spitz named Luna. She is very precious to me. She is now slightly over a year old and still so full of energy and covered with fluff!</p>
        <strong>Here are some things that Luna loves:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Ham</li>
            <li>Mango</li>
            <li>Toys</li>
            <li>Attention</li>
            <li>Walks</li>
            <li>People</li>
            <li>and of course, belly rubs!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I grew up with the Pokemon franchise, and to this day, continue to splurge too much money into it.</p>
